# Multithreading with Image Filtering in Swift

Multithreading may seem esoteric and dense, but it's important in many situations that involve network calls or heavy processing. With so many apps in the App Store, the [user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2016/04/27/ui-vs-ux/) of your app must be as close to flawless as possible for it to stand out. You can hire a team of designers to create the most beautiful graphics for your photo filtering app, but it won't do any good if the whole thing suddenly freezes when a user attempts to process an image!

To that end you can use multithreading to run heavy processes off the main thread of a device, thereby ensuring the user interface doesn't stutter and the user experience is maintained.

The image above shows three things. First, on the left, you see a representation of a *synchronous* process being run on a single thread of a processor. Each green block, which represents an action, must complete before the next green block can be processed. Second, on the right, is a representation of a synchronous process being run with multithreading. With more threads, multiple green blocks can be processed at the same time and the process on the right completes more quickly.

The third concept illustrated by this animation is the larger picture of these two processes being run simultaneously. These processes are running *asynchronously*, which means the speed or completion of one process does not rely on the speed or completion of the other.

In this lab you will create a Flatigram app, which applies filters to images that a user can select from their photo library.

## Goals

* When the `Antique` button is tapped, an activity indicator should be presented and animated to show the user some processing is going on. This activity indicator should stop when the image is filtered.
* We also want to allow the user to continue to pan and zoom the image while the filtration occurs in the background.
* When the camera button is tapped, the user should be able to select a photo from the device's photo library.

## Instructions

There are some hints included in the following instructions. **Try to complete each step step without the hints first, then look at the hints only if you get stuck.**

### Create a `FlatigramImage` class

This class should have two properties: an `image` of type UIImage and a `state` of type ImageState.

`ImageState` is an enumeration that doesn't yet exist. Create an enum with two cases: `filtered` and `unfiltered`.

### Give images the ability to filter

Write an extension for the `UIImage` class called `filter(with:)` that takes in a single `String` argument, which will be the name of the filter to apply. This function should return an optional `UIImage`.

Inside this function you'll need to start by converting the `UIImage` to a `CIImage`. 

```swift
extension UIImage {
    
    func filter(with filter: String) -> UIImage? {
        
        let coreImage = CIImage(image: self)
        let openGLContext = EAGLContext(api: .openGLES3)
        let context = CIContext(eaglContext: openGLContext!)
        let ciFilter = CIFilter(name: filter)
        ciFilter?.setValue(coreImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
        
        guard let coreImageOutput = ciFilter?.value(forKey: kCIOutputImageKey) as? CIImage else {
            print("Could not unwrap output of CIFilter: \(filter)")
            return nil
        }
        
        let output = context.createCGImage(coreImageOutput, from: coreImageOutput.extent)
        let result = UIImage(cgImage: output!)
        
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(result.size, false, result.scale)
        result.draw(at: CGPoint.zero)
        guard let finalResult = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() else {
            print("Could not save final UIImage")
            return nil
        }
        
        UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
        
        return finalResult
    }
    
}
```

### Show an activity indicator
 
* Add a `UIActivityIndicatorView` to the Flatirgram app. Instead of doing this in Interface Builder, add it programmatically.
* Next, within the `setupViews` function in the `ImageViewController` extension, set up the activity indicator. Make the activity indicator `.cyan` and centered in the main view.

> **Hint:** In the `ImageViewController` class, add a property called `activityIndicator` of type `UIActivityIndicatorView!`. Use the following code to set it up properly in the extension:

```swift
activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(activityIndicatorStyle: .whiteLarge)
activityIndicator.color = UIColor.cyan
activityIndicator.center = view.center
view.addSubview(activityIndicator)
```

> Here we instantiate a `UIActivityIndicatorView` object for the property we just created with the stile of `.whiteLarge`. We then tint the indicator so it fits the theme of our app, and finally align it with the main view.

* If you run the app now and hit `Antique`, you'll see the activity indicator still doesn't appear. We're not done yet! The `UIActivityIndicatorView` has been created, but hasn't been added to the superview. Do this with . This adds our `activityIndicator` to the view controller's `view`.
* The last step we need to make our `activityIndicator` visible is to call it to start. Use the following lines to start and stop the indicator, respectively:

```swift
activityIndicator.startAnimating()  // Presents and starts the activity indicator
activityIndicator.stopAnimating()   // Hides and stops the activity indicator
```

* Add just the `startAnimating` line to your `viewDidLoad` and run your app. You should see a blue spinning activity indicator. We don't want the indicator to start as soon as the app opens, though, and we don't want it to keep going after the image has been filtered. Let's move this start function call to the `antiqueButtonTapped` function ahead of the call to `filterImage`.
* Uh oh! If you run the app now and tap `Antique` you'll see that the activity indicator doesn't appear until after the image has finished filtering. Try to add the `stopAnimating` call on the `activityIndicator` to the completion block for the call to `filterImage`. Now the indicator never shows!
* It looks like the filtering process is blocking the indicator, so we'll have to move the filtering to a different thread.

### Allow for user interaction during filtering

* Create a new `NSOperationQueue` in `antiqueButtonTapped` and set its `qualityOfService` to `.userInitiated`. Next, move into this block the call to the `filterImage` function and its completion block, which prints based on the result. The `qualityOfService` parameter, futher discussed in [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/PrioritizeWorkWithQoS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015243-CH39-SW1), is used to ensure the correct priority for system resources is given to the passed-in block of code.
* Inside the completion block of the call to `filterImage`, add a new operation block on the `mainQueue` which will wrap the previous contents of the completion block. This ensures that when `filterImage` has completed and returned, the activity indicator's status will be updated on the main thread.
* We still need to update the `imageView` in the main thread. Look for the line in `filterImage` where we print out "Setting final result". Add a `mainQueue` operation block and insert the two lines where we set the `imageView`'s `image` to `finalResult` and return `true` to the completion block.
* Now everything should work as expected and the user will never be left *hanging* for a filtering process! ðŸ˜‰

### Advanced

* Play around with other filters and see what you can create! Here's a [list of all available CIFilters](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html) to get you started.
* Add a camera button to the nav bar which presents an alert asking if the user wants to load a photo from the library or take a photo with the camera. In either case, the new photo should be loaded into the Flatigram app, ready for antiquing.
* Figure out a way to cache filtered images so if they've already been filtered, the filtered version is loaded right away upon selecting that photo.
* Add the ability to cancel a filter operation midway.
